> **⚠️ IMPORTANT NOTE**: While the CLI is functional and actively used in production, nself is under heavy development until v0.5 (see [roadmap](docs/ROADMAP.md)). Bugs are expected as we refine features and add capabilities. We recommend production use only for experienced users comfortable with Docker, self-hosting, and troubleshooting. 
> 
> That said, nself is essentially a helper tool that generates Docker Compose configurations and wraps Docker commands - tasks you'd need to handle manually with any self-hosted backend solution (Nhost, Supabase, or others). The underlying services (PostgreSQL, Hasura, etc.) are production-ready; it's the orchestration layer that's evolving.
> 
> We welcome bug reports and appreciate your patience as we work toward these goals!

## 💡 Hello World Example

The included hello world example shows all services working together:

```bash
# Enable all services in .env
SERVICES_ENABLED=true
REDIS_ENABLED=true
NESTJS_ENABLED=true
NESTJS_SERVICES=weather-actions
BULLMQ_ENABLED=true
BULLMQ_WORKERS=weather-processor,currency-processor

```

**Architecture:**
- **NestJS**: Hasura actions for weather API integration
- **BullMQ**: Background processing of weather/currency data
- **GoLang**: High-performance currency rate fetching
- **Python**: ML predictions on time-series data

All services communicate through:
- Shared PostgreSQL database (with TimescaleDB)
- Redis for queuing and caching
- Direct HTTP calls via Docker network

## 🔧 Core Services

### Required Services
- **PostgreSQL**: Primary database with optional extensions
- **Hasura GraphQL**: Instant GraphQL API for your database
- **Hasura Auth**: JWT-based authentication service
- **MinIO**: S3-compatible object storage
- **Nginx**: Reverse proxy with SSL termination

### Optional Services

## 🔐 SSL/TLS Configuration

nself provides bulletproof SSL with green locks in browsers - no warnings!

### Two Domain Options (Both Work Perfectly)

1. **`*.localhost`** - Works offline, no DNS needed
2. **`*.local.nself.org`** - Our loopback domain (resolves to 127.0.0.1)

### Automatic Certificate Generation

```bash
nself build    # Automatically generates SSL certificates
nself trust    # Install root CA for green locks (one-time)
```

That's it! Your browser will show green locks for:
- https://localhost, https://api.localhost, etc.
- https://local.nself.org, https://api.local.nself.org, etc.

### Advanced: Public Wildcard Certificates

For teams or CI/CD, get globally-trusted certificates (no `nself trust` needed):

```bash
# Add to .env
DNS_PROVIDER=cloudflare        # or route53, digitalocean
DNS_API_TOKEN=your_api_token

# Generate public wildcard
nself ssl bootstrap
```

Supported DNS providers:
- Cloudflare (recommended)
- AWS Route53
- DigitalOcean
- And more via acme.sh

### SSL Commands

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `nself ssl bootstrap` | Generate SSL certificates |
| `nself ssl renew` | Renew public certificates |
| `nself ssl status` | Check certificate status |
| `nself trust` | Install root CA to system |
| `nself trust status` | Check trust status |

RCLONE_REMOTE=myremote
```

### What Gets Backed Up

**Full Backup includes:**
- PostgreSQL databases (complete dump)
- All environment files (.env.dev, .env.staging, .env.prod, .env.secrets, .env)
- Docker-compose configurations
- Docker volumes (all project data)
- SSL certificates
- Hasura metadata
- Nginx configurations

## 🚀 Production Deployment

### Using nself prod Command

The `nself prod` command automatically generates secure passwords for production:

```bash
# 1. Generate production configuration with secure passwords
nself prod

# This creates:
# - .env.prod-template (ready-to-use production config)
# - .env.prod-secrets (backup of generated passwords)

# 2. Edit .env.prod-template to set your domain and email

# 3. Deploy to production
cp .env.prod-template .env
nself start
```

Environment files are loaded in priority order (highest priority last):
- `.env.dev` - Team defaults (always loaded)
- `.env.staging` - Staging environment (if ENV=staging)
- `.env.prod` - Production environment (if ENV=prod)
- `.env.secrets` - Production secrets (if ENV=prod)
- `.env` - Local overrides (highest priority)

### Production Checklist
1. Set `ENV=prod` (automatically configures security settings)
2. Use strong passwords (12+ characters, auto-generated by `nself prod`)
3. Configure your custom domain
4. Enable Let's Encrypt SSL
5. Set up automated backups
6. Configure monitoring alerts

### Database Seeding Strategy

When `DB_ENV_SEEDS=true` (recommended - follows Hasura/PostgreSQL standards):
- `seeds/common/` - Shared data across all environments
- `seeds/development/` - Mock/test data (when ENV=dev)
- `seeds/staging/` - Staging data (when ENV=staging) 
- `seeds/production/` - Minimal production data (when ENV=prod)

When `DB_ENV_SEEDS=false` (no environment branching):
- `seeds/default/` - Single seed directory for all environments

See [DBTOOLS.md](DBTOOLS.md) for complete database documentation.

## 🔄 Updating Services

To update service configurations:

1. Edit `.env`
2. Run `nself build` to regenerate configurations
3. Run `nself start` to apply changes

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### Build command hangs?
```bash
# Build includes 5-second timeout for validation
nself build --force  # Force rebuild if stuck
```

#### Services not starting?
```bash
# Run diagnostics first
nself doctor

# Check service logs
nself logs [service-name]

# Check service status
nself status
```

#### Auth service unhealthy?
Known issue: Auth health check reports unhealthy but service works (port 4001 vs 4000 mismatch).

#### Port conflicts?
Edit the port numbers in `.env` and rebuild.

#### SSL certificate warnings?
Run `nself trust` to install the root CA and get green locks in your browser. No more warnings!

#### Email test not working?
```bash
# SMTP testing uses swaks Docker container
nself email test recipient@example.com
```
